## Overview

**Isaac Lab-Arena** is an open-source extension to [NVIDIA Isaac Lab](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab) for simplified task curation and robotic policy evaluation at scale. It provides a composable architecture where environments are assembled on-the-fly from independent, reusable building blocks — eliminating the redundant boilerplate that plagues traditional task library development.

Instead of hand-writing and maintaining a separate configuration for every combination of robot, object, and scenario, Arena lets you **compose** environments from three independent primitives:

| Primitive | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Scene** | The physical environment layout — a collection of objects, furniture, fixtures |
| **Embodiment** | The robot and its observations, actions, sensors, and controllers |
| **Task** | The objective — what the robot should accomplish (pick-and-place, open door, etc.) |

The `ArenaEnvBuilder` composes these primitives into a standard `ManagerBasedRLEnvCfg` that runs natively in Isaac Lab.

## Why Isaac Lab-Arena?

With the rise of generalist robot policies (e.g., [GR00T N](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/gr00t), [pi0](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/), [SmolVLA](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/smolvla)), there is an urgent need to evaluate these policies across many diverse tasks and environments. Traditional approaches suffer from:

- **Code duplication** — each task variation (different object, different robot) requires a near-copy of the same configuration
- **Maintenance burden** — N robots × M objects × K scenes = an explosion of configs to keep in sync
- **Slow iteration** — researchers spend more time wrangling configs than running experiments

Arena solves this by making environment variation a first-class concept. Swap an object, change a robot, or modify a scene — all without duplicating a single line of task logic.

## Key Features

- **LEGO-like Composable Environments** — Mix and match scenes,  embodiments, and tasks independently
- **On-the-fly Assembly** — Environments are built at runtime; no duplicate config files to maintain.
- **New Sequential Task Chaining** — Chain atomic skills (e.g. Pick + Walk + Place + …) to create complex long-horizon tasks.
- **New Natural Language Object Placement** — Define scene layouts using semantic relationships like "on" or "next to", instead of manually specified coordinates.
- **Integrated Evaluation** — Extensible metrics and evaluation pipelines for policy benchmarking
- **New Large-scale Parallel Evaluations with Heterogeneous Objects** — Evaluate policy on multiple parallel environments, each with different objects, to maximize evaluation throughput.
- **New RL Workflow Support and Seamless Interoperation with Isaac Lab: Plug Isaac Lab** - Arena environments into Isaac Lab workflows for Reinforcement learning and Data generation for imitation learning.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+)
- NVIDIA GPU (see [Isaac Sim hardware requirements](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/6.0.0/installation/requirements.html))
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (for the native install), or Docker and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit (for the container install)
- Git

### Installation

**Native developer setup with uv:**

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:isaac-sim/IsaacLab-Arena.git
cd IsaacLab-Arena

# 2. Create the locked environment (Isaac Lab from source, plus the Isaac Sim, PyTorch, and Newton wheels)
uv sync

# 3. Activate the environment and accept the Isaac Sim EULA
source .venv/bin/activate
export OMNI_KIT_ACCEPT_EULA=YES ACCEPT_EULA=Y

# 4. Verify the installation with a short zero-action rollout
python isaaclab_arena/evaluation/policy_runner.py \
  --policy_type zero_action --num_steps 20 cube_goal_pose

# 4b. (Optional) Watch the rollout in the GUI visualizer
python isaaclab_arena/evaluation/policy_runner.py \
  --viz kit --policy_type zero_action --num_steps 200 cube_goal_pose
```

> **Note:** See our
> [installation docs](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab-Arena/main/pages/quickstart/installation.html)
> for more details and installation flavors.

**Source install inside Docker:**

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:isaac-sim/IsaacLab-Arena.git
cd IsaacLab-Arena
git submodule update --init --recursive

# 2. Launch the Docker container
#    Base container (recommended for development):
./docker/run_docker.sh

#    Or with GR00T dependencies (for policy training/evaluation):
./docker/run_docker.sh -g

# 3. Verify the installation with a short zero-action rollout
/isaac-sim/python.sh isaaclab_arena/evaluation/policy_runner.py \
  --policy_type zero_action --num_steps 20 cube_goal_pose

# 3b. (Optional) Watch the rollout in the GUI visualizer
/isaac-sim/python.sh isaaclab_arena/evaluation/policy_runner.py \
  --viz kit --policy_type zero_action --num_steps 200 cube_goal_pose
```

> **Note:** The Docker script automatically mounts `$HOME/datasets`, `$HOME/models`, and `$HOME/eval` from your host into the container.

For detailed setup instructions (including server-client mode for GR00T), see the [Installation Guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab-Arena/main/pages/quickstart/installation.html).

## Usage Example

Compose a Franka arm in a kitchen scene with a couple of objects:

```python
from isaaclab_arena.assets.asset_registry import AssetRegistry
from isaaclab_arena.environments.arena_env_builder import ArenaEnvBuilder, ArenaEnvBuilderCfg
from isaaclab_arena.environments.isaaclab_arena_environment import IsaacLabArenaEnvironment
from isaaclab_arena.scene.scene import Scene

asset_registry = AssetRegistry()

# Select building blocks
background = asset_registry.get_asset_by_name("kitchen")()
embodiment = asset_registry.get_asset_by_name("franka_ik")()
cracker_box = asset_registry.get_asset_by_name("cracker_box")()
tomato_soup_can = asset_registry.get_asset_by_name("tomato_soup_can")()

# Compose the environment
scene = Scene(assets=[background, cracker_box, tomato_soup_can])
env_cfg = IsaacLabArenaEnvironment(
    name="franka_kitchen_example",
    embodiment=embodiment,
    scene=scene,
)

builder_cfg = ArenaEnvBuilderCfg()
env_builder = ArenaEnvBuilder(env_cfg, builder_cfg)
env = env_builder.make_registered()
env.reset()
```

Python callers set builder options directly on `ArenaEnvBuilderCfg`. Runner scripts
continue to accept the same options as CLI flags, such as `--num_envs 4 --seed 7`,
and translate them into an `ArenaEnvBuilderCfg` before building the environment.

## ⚠️ Project Status

Isaac Lab-Arena is in **alpha** (`v0.2.x`). This is important to understand:

| What This Means | Details |
|-----------------|---------|
| **Not EA / GA** | This is not an Early Access or General Availability release. It is a very early community code drop. |
| **APIs will break** | Public interfaces are under active development and will change without deprecation warnings. |
| **Features are incomplete** | Core capabilities like agentic task generation, non-sequential long horizon tasks, easy-to-configure sensitivity analysis, and enhanced heterogeneity across parallel evaluations are planned but not yet implemented. |
| **Limited testing** | The `main` branch contains the latest code but may not be fully tested. Use `release/0.2.0` for the most stable experience. |

### Publishing Your Own Benchmark

We encourage the community to build and publish benchmarks on Isaac Lab-Arena. The recommended workflow:

1. **Maintain your benchmark in your own repository.** Create a branch or package that integrates with Isaac Lab-Arena (e.g. an `IsaacLab-Arena` branch). See [RoboTwin](https://github.com/RoboTwin-Platform/RoboTwin/tree/IsaacLab-Arena) for a reference example. For detailed setup instructions — including repository layout, Dockerfile setup, and how to register custom environments/robots/tasks — see the [Arena in Your Repository](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab-Arena/main/pages/arena_in_your_repo/index.html) guide.
2. **Reference your benchmark and Isaac Lab-Arena in publications.** When publishing on ArXiv or elsewhere, cite both your benchmark (by name, with a link to your repository) and Isaac Lab-Arena as the underlying evaluation framework.
3. **List it here.** Open a PR to add your benchmark to the [Published Benchmarks](#published-benchmarks) list above. This README serves as the single source of truth for the Arena benchmark ecosystem so that community can discover and reuse.
