GR00T
=====

`GR00T N1.6 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T/>`_ is a pre-trained robotic
foundation model. No fine-tuning or separate model download is required. The weights
are fetched from `HuggingFace <https://huggingface.co/nvidia/GR00T-N1.6-DROID>`_
when the policy server starts for the first time.

Start a GR00T policy server
---------------------------

The closed-loop policy connects to a GR00T policy server in a separate process. The
server runs from the
`Isaac-GR00T <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T/tree/e29d8fc50b0e4745120ae3fb72447986fe638aa6>`_
submodule pinned at commit ``e29d8fc``. Populate it if needed:

.. code-block:: bash

   git submodule update --init submodules/Isaac-GR00T

.. note::

   Blackwell GPUs with compute capability ``sm_120`` require CUDA 12.8 or newer. The
   `official GR00T documentation <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T/blob/e29d8fc50b0e4745120ae3fb72447986fe638aa6/README.md?plain=1#L102>`_
   specify CUDA 12.8 and ``pytorch-cu128`` for RTX 5090 systems. Please refer to the
   documentation for the latest requirements.

Then start the server from the repository root in a separate shell:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd submodules/Isaac-GR00T
   uv run python gr00t/eval/run_gr00t_server.py \
     --model-path nvidia/GR00T-N1.6-DROID \
     --embodiment-tag OXE_DROID \
     --device cuda --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5555

GR00T N1.6-DROID provides its own modality configuration, so the command does not need
``--modality-config-path``. The first launch downloads the model weights; later launches
reuse the local cache. Leave this server running.


Run GR00T with the Experiment Runner
------------------------------------

If you run Arena from its native ``uv`` environment, install the GR00T client
package:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv sync --group gr00t-client

Arena includes a one-Run YAML configuration for the first rollout. It selects the
DROID environment, connects the GR00T policy to the server, and stops after three episodes.

.. dropdown:: Configuration file (``droid_pnp_gr00t_experiment.yaml``)
   :animate: fade-in

   .. literalinclude:: ../../../../isaaclab_arena_environments/experiment_configs/droid_pnp_gr00t_experiment.yaml
      :language: yaml

GR00T N1.6-DROID uses absolute joint positions. The YAML therefore selects
``droid_abs_joint_pos`` and enables the cameras required by the policy. The natural-language
instruction belongs to the environment builder, while the server connection belongs to the
policy.

Open another shell, enter the Arena container, and start the rollout with the Experiment Runner:

.. code-block:: bash

   python isaaclab_arena/evaluation/experiment_runner.py \
     --viz kit \
     --experiment_config isaaclab_arena_environments/experiment_configs/droid_pnp_gr00t_experiment.yaml

The Kit window shows the DROID arm acting on GR00T commands. After every episode, Arena
reports whether the pick-and-place task succeeded.

If the server runs on another host or port, override the declared policy value. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   python isaaclab_arena/evaluation/experiment_runner.py \
     --viz kit \
     --experiment_config isaaclab_arena_environments/experiment_configs/droid_pnp_gr00t_experiment.yaml \
     runs.droid_pnp_gr00t.policy.remote_port=5556

Evaluate several object variations
----------------------------------

The multi-Run YAML evaluates nine combinations of pick-up object, destination, HDR background,
and language instruction. Its ``shared`` mapping keeps the GR00T policy and rollout settings in
one place. Every Run lists only what changes.

.. dropdown:: Configuration file (``droid_pnp_srl_gr00t_experiment.yaml``)
   :animate: fade-in

   .. literalinclude:: ../../../../isaaclab_arena_environments/experiment_configs/droid_pnp_srl_gr00t_experiment.yaml
      :language: yaml

Start all nine Runs with one command:

.. code-block:: bash

   python isaaclab_arena/evaluation/experiment_runner.py \
     --viz kit \
     --experiment_config isaaclab_arena_environments/experiment_configs/droid_pnp_srl_gr00t_experiment.yaml

The runner executes the nine Runs in YAML order. It keeps one SimulationApp open, but builds a
fresh environment for every Run.

.. figure:: ../../../images/gr00t_droid_3x3_grid.gif
   :width: 100%
   :alt: 3x3 grid of GR00T N1.6 DROID Runs across different objects, backgrounds, and destinations
   :align: center

   Nine closed-loop Runs of GR00T N1.6 on the DROID embodiment. Each cell changes the
   pick-up object, HDR background, and destination.

When all Runs finish, Arena prints a summary table followed by a metrics report:

.. dropdown:: Example Run summary and metrics
   :animate: fade-in

   Metric values can vary between evaluations. This is example output:

These results show that zero-shot deployment of robotic foundation models remains
challenging. Recent
`[robolab] <https://gitlab-master.nvidia.com/xuningy/robolab/-/blob/main/docs/analysis.md>`_
results compare GR00T with other vision-language-action models.


View rollouts as an HTML report
-------------------------------

The runner builds an HTML report for the complete evaluation. Add ``--record_camera_video`` to
record one video per camera and episode, then use
``--serve_evaluation_report`` to open the report through a local HTTP server:

.. code-block:: bash

   python isaaclab_arena/evaluation/experiment_runner.py \
     --viz kit \
     --experiment_config isaaclab_arena_environments/experiment_configs/droid_pnp_srl_gr00t_experiment.yaml \
     --output_base_dir ./output \
     --record_camera_video \
     --serve_evaluation_report

You can rebuild and serve a report later by pointing the standalone tool at the output
directory. It selects the most recent evaluation:

.. code-block:: bash

   python isaaclab_arena/visualization/report.py --video_dir ./output
