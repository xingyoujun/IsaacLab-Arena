Installation
============

This page describes how to install Isaac Lab Arena, either natively with ``uv``
or from source inside a Docker container.

Supported Systems
-----------------

Isaac Lab Arena runs on Isaac Sim ``6.0.1`` and Isaac Lab ``3.0.0``.
The dependencies are installed automatically by either workflow below.
Hardware requirements for Isaac Lab Arena are shared with Isaac Sim, and are detailed in
`Isaac Sim Requirements <https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/6.0.0/installation/requirements.html>`_.


Native uv developer setup
-------------------------

Isaac Lab Arena can be installed natively with `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`_;
the committed lockfile pins the complete environment. Isaac Lab is installed
editable from the ``submodules/IsaacLab`` checkout.

Clone the repository:

:isaaclab_arena_git_clone_code_block:

Sync the environment and activate it:

.. code-block:: bash

    uv sync --extra dev
    source .venv/bin/activate

``uv sync`` creates a Python virtual environment in ``.venv/`` (pinned by
``.python-version``), installs Isaac Lab Arena and Isaac Lab editable from
``submodules/IsaacLab``, and pulls the matching Isaac Sim, PyTorch, and Newton
wheels at the versions pinned by the committed lockfile. The ``dev`` extra
installs the Streamlit and SimReady search dependencies used by the
:doc:`agentic environment generation workflow
</pages/concepts/agentic_environment_generation/index>`.

.. note::
   Native ``uv`` installs do not include the optional ``isaaclab_arena_curobo``
   package, so :doc:`cuRobo-based reachability validation
   </pages/concepts/object_placement/validation>` (the ``ik_reachable`` check)
   is not available. Use the Docker workflow with ``./docker/run_docker.sh -c``
   instead.

Accept the Isaac Sim EULA so the first launch is non-interactive:

.. code-block:: bash

    export OMNI_KIT_ACCEPT_EULA=YES ACCEPT_EULA=Y

Launch a short zero-action rollout as a visual validation that things are
running:

.. code-block:: bash

    python isaaclab_arena/evaluation/policy_runner.py \
      --policy_type zero_action --num_steps 20 cube_goal_pose

Optionally, watch the rollout in the GUI visualizer by adding ``--viz kit`` (and
a few more steps so there is time to see it):

.. code-block:: bash

    python isaaclab_arena/evaluation/policy_runner.py \
      --viz kit --policy_type zero_action --num_steps 200 cube_goal_pose

Optionally verify the installation by running the test phases:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest -sv -m "not with_cameras and not with_subprocess" isaaclab_arena/tests/
    pytest -sv -m "with_cameras and not with_subprocess" isaaclab_arena/tests/
    pytest -sv -m with_subprocess isaaclab_arena/tests/

With ``isaaclab_arena`` installed you're ready to build your first environment;
see :doc:`arena_env`.


Installation via Docker
-----------------------


Isaac Lab Arena supports installation from source inside a Docker container.
Future versions of Isaac Lab Arena, we will support a larger range of
installation options.


1. **Clone the repository and initialize submodules:**

:isaaclab_arena_git_clone_code_block:

2. **Launch the docker container:**

:docker_run_default:

The container will build (if needed) and drop you into an interactive shell.

For :doc:`cuRobo-based reachability validation
</pages/concepts/object_placement/validation>`, launch with the ``-c`` flag
instead (native ``uv`` installs do not support this check):

:docker_run_curobo:

.. note::
   The run docker script mounts the following directories from the host machine if they exist:

   - **Datasets**: ``$HOME/datasets`` → ``/datasets``
   - **Models**: ``$HOME/models`` → ``/models``
   - **Evaluation**: ``$HOME/eval`` → ``/eval``

   When mounted a user avoids re-downloading datasets and models between container restarts,
   so our suggestion is to create these directories on the host machine before running the container.
   Note that the path of the mounted directories are configurable — see ``docker/run_docker.sh``
   for the full list of arguments.

3. **Optionally verify installation by running tests:**

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest -sv -m "with_cameras and not with_subprocess" isaaclab_arena/tests/
    pytest -sv -m "not with_cameras and not with_subprocess" isaaclab_arena/tests/
    pytest -sv -m with_subprocess isaaclab_arena/tests/

With ``isaaclab_arena`` installed and the docker running, you're ready to build your
first IsaacLab-Arena Environment. See :doc:`arena_env` to get started.
