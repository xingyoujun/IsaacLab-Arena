Release Notes
=============

Isaac Lab Arena
---------------

Isaac Lab-Arena focuses on adding essential features needed for creation and
execution of large-scale task libraries with complex long-horizon tasks.

**Key Features**

- **LEGO-like Composable Environments** — Mix and match scenes,  embodiments, and tasks independently
- **On-the-fly Assembly** — Environments are built at runtime; no duplicate config files to maintain.
- **New Sequential Task Chaining** — Chain atomic skills (e.g. Pick + Walk + Place + …) to create complex long-horizon tasks.
- **New Natural Language Object Placement** — Define scene layouts using semantic relationships
  like "on" or "next to", instead of manually specified coordinates.
- **Integrated Evaluation** — Extensible metrics and evaluation pipelines for policy benchmarking
- **New Large-scale Parallel Evaluations with Heterogeneous Objects** — Evaluate policy on multiple parallel
  environments, each with different objects, to maximize evaluation throughput.
- **New RL Workflow Support and Seamless Interoperation with Isaac Lab** — Plug Isaac Lab-Arena environments
  into Isaac Lab workflows for Reinforcement learning and Data generation for imitation learning.


**Ecosystem**
Isaac Lab-Arena is part of a growing ecosystem of tools and benchmarks. NVIDIA and partners are building
industrial and academic benchmarks on the unified Isaac Lab-Arena core, so you can reuse building blocks
(tasks, scenes, metrics, and datasets) for your custom evaluations.

- `Lightwheel RoboFinals <https://lightwheel.ai/robofinals>`_ — High-fidelity industrial benchmarks.
- `Lightwheel RoboCasa Tasks <https://github.com/LightwheelAI/LW-BenchHub>`_ — 138+ open-source tasks,
  50 datasets per task, 7+ robots.
- `Lightwheel LIBERO Tasks <https://github.com/LightwheelAI/LW-BenchHub>`_ — Adapted LIBERO benchmarks.
- `RoboTwin 2.0 <https://github.com/RoboTwin-Platform/RoboTwin/tree/IsaacLab-Arena>`_ — Extended simulation
  benchmarks using Arena; `Arxiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.01229>`_.
- `LeRobot Environment Hub <https://huggingface.co/blog/nvidia/generalist-robotpolicy-eval-isaaclab-arena-lerobot>`_ — Share
  and discover Arena environments on Hugging Face.
- `Isaac for Healthcare RHEO Workflows <https://github.com/isaac-for-healthcare/i4h-workflows/tree/main/workflows/rheo>`_ — Healthcare
  robotics benchmark workflows.

NIST Board 1, NVIDIA Isaac GR00T Industrial Benchmarks, NVIDIA DexBench, NVIDIA RoboLab, and more benchmarks
are coming soon.

**Collaboration**

Isaac Lab-Arena is being developed as an open-source, shared evaluation framework that the community can
collectively enhance and expand. We invite you to try Isaac Lab-Arena 0.2 Alpha, share feedback, and help
shape its future. In Alpha stage, development velocity is high and core features/APIs are evolving. Your
input at this stage is especially valuable.

**What's Next**

Future releases will focus on agentic, prompt-first scene and task generation, non-sequential long horizon
tasks, easy-to-configure sensitivity analysis with targeted environment variations and evaluation sweeps without
code changes, enhanced heterogeneity across parallel evaluations, and VLM-augmented analysis to surface
insights from large-scale evaluations. These will come with ongoing improvements to performance and usability,
such as PIP packaging.

**Limitations**

- Installation from a published Python package is not yet supported; use the native ``uv`` source workflow or Docker.
- Performance is not yet hardened for production-scale workloads in Alpha stage.

v0.1.1
------

This release includes bug fixes, documentation improvements, CI and infrastructure
updates, and several API and workflow enhancements over v0.1.0.

**Features and improvements**

- **Object configuration:** Object configuration is now created as soon as an asset is
  called, so users can edit object properties before a scene is created (#239).
- **Scene export:** Added support for saving a scene to a flattened USD file (#237).
  Scene export now correctly handles double-precision poses and adds contact reporters
  when exporting rigid objects (#242).
- **Parallel environment evaluation:** Enabled parallel environment evaluation for
  GR00T policy runner, with documentation for closed-loop GR00T workflows (#231, #236).
- **Episode length:** Increased episode length for loco-manipulation to support
  rollout through box drop (#235).
- **Microwave example:** Increased reset openness for the microwave example (#311).

**Bug fixes**

- **Reference object poses:** Fixed reference object poses so they correctly account
  for the parent object’s initial pose; poses are now relative and composed at compile
  time (#232).
- **IsaacLab-to-stage path conversion:** Fixed a bug when the asset name appeared twice
  in the prim path (replaced both instances instead of one) (#241).
- **qpsolvers:** Patched breakage with Isaac Lab 2.3 due to ``qpsolvers`` upgrade by
  pinning to 4.8.1 (#252).
- **Parallel eval:** Removed comments that were breaking the parallel eval run
  commands (#262).

**Documentation**

- **Multi-versioned docs:** Documentation is now versioned so users can read docs that
  match their release (#272, #300).
- **Links and structure:** Updated README docs link to the public location (#270),
  corrected doc pointers (#301), and added release warnings (#303).
- **Installation:** Private Omniverse/Nucleus access is described on a separate page
  to clarify it is not required for normal installation (#261).

**Infrastructure and CI**

- **Runners:** Release 0.1.1 CI runners moved from local (Zurich) to AWS (#433).
- **CI workflow:** Added YAML anchors to reduce repetition in the CI workflow (#245).
- **Contribution guide:** Added signoff requirements for external contributions (#238).
- **Docker:** Fixed Dockerfile pip usage and added SSL certificate support for
  Lightwheel SDK (#449).
- **Tests:** Finetuned GR00T locomanip model is now generated on the fly in tests
  instead of mounting a pre-finetuned models directory, improving public CI
  compatibility and testing the fine-tuning pipeline (#247).

**Assets and tests**

- **G1 WBC:** Updated G1 WBC embodiment file paths to use S3 (#251).
- **Test assets:** Removed internal or custom-only assets from tests: custom cracker
  box (#234), custom USD in ObjectReference test (#240), internal asset from USD
  utils test (#244). ObjectReference test now composes USD on the fly via scene
  export (#240).


v0.1.0
------

This initial release of Isaac Lab Arena delivers the first version of the
composable task definition API.
Also included are example workflows for static manipulation tasks and loco-manipulation
tasks including GR00T GN1.5 finetuning and evaluation.

Key features of this release include:

- **Composable Task Definition:** Base-class definition for ``Task``, ``Embodiment``, and ``Scene``
  that can be subclassed to create new tasks, embodiments, and scenes.
  ``ArenaEnvBuilder`` for converting ``Scene``, ``Embodiment``, and ``Task`` into an
  Isaac Lab runnable environment.
- **Metrics:** Mechanism for adding task-specific metrics which are reported during evaluation.
- **Isaac Lab Mimic Integration:** Integration with Isaac Lab Mimic to automatically generate Mimic definitions for
  available tasks.
- **Example Workflows:** Two example workflows for static manipulation tasks and loco-manipulation tasks.
- **GR00T GN1.5 Integration:** Integration with GR00T GN1.5 including a example workflows for finetuning and evaluating
  the model on the static and loco-manipulation workflows.

Known limitations:

- **Number of Environments/Tasks:** This initial is intended to validation the composable task
  definition API, and comes with a limited set of tasks and workflows.
- **Loco-manipulation GR00T GN1.5 finetuning:** GR00T GN1.5 finetuning for loco-manipulation
  requires a large amount of GPU resources. (Note that static manipulation finetuning can be
  performed on a single GPU.)
