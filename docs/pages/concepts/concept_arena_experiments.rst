Arena Experiments
=================

An Arena Experiment groups one or more named Runs into one evaluation. Each Run selects an
existing Environment Definition and combines it with a policy and the settings that control the
rollout.

The **Experiment Definition** is the YAML file that describes those Runs. It is the main interface
for evaluation: run the same definition locally with the Experiment Runner, or submit it to OSMO
for managed execution.

.. note::

   A Run can reuse either form of :doc:`Environment Definition
   <environment/environment_definition>`:

   * a registered Python environment, selected by name in ``environment.type``; or
   * an existing ``ArenaEnvGraphSpec`` YAML file, selected by its path in ``environment.type``.

   Different Runs in the same Experiment can use different forms.

   The Experiment Definition describes the evaluation. The Environment Definition describes the
   scene, embodiment, and task. Each Run builds a fresh runtime environment from that definition.

.. grid:: 1 1 3 3
   :gutter: 2

   .. grid-item-card:: Experiment Definition
      :class-card: sd-shadow-sm

      The typed YAML file. It holds shared values and one or more named Runs.

   .. grid-item-card:: Run
      :class-card: sd-shadow-sm

      One Environment Definition combined with one policy and rollout settings. A Run can contain
      many parallel simulated environments.

   .. grid-item-card:: Execution
      :class-card: sd-shadow-sm

      The Experiment Runner executes locally. OSMO schedules the same Runs on managed compute.


The Experiment Definition
-------------------------

The YAML has a required ``runs`` mapping. A ``shared`` mapping is optional. When present, its
values are reused by every Run. Each key below ``runs`` is a Run name:

.. code-block:: yaml

   shared:
     environment:
       type: pick_and_place_maple_table
       embodiment: droid_rel_joint_pos
       hdr: home_office_robolab
     policy:
       type: zero_action
     rollout_limit:
       num_steps: 50

   runs:
     baseline: {}

     billiard_hall:
       environment:
         hdr: billiard_hall_robolab

``baseline`` inherits all shared values. ``billiard_hall`` inherits them too, then replaces only
the background. The Run name comes from its key below ``runs``; there is no separate ``name``
field. Arena uses this name in command-line overrides, output directories, and reports.

Runs keep their YAML order and execute locally in that order.

One definition, two execution paths
-----------------------------------

.. grid:: 1 1 2 2
   :gutter: 3

   .. grid-item-card:: Local — Experiment Runner
      :class-card: sd-shadow-sm

      Loads the YAML once and executes its Runs in order in one process and one
      SimulationApp. Every Run builds a fresh environment. The runner stops at the first failure
      unless ``--continue_on_error`` is set.

   .. grid-item-card:: Managed — OSMO
      :class-card: sd-shadow-sm

      Turns every Run into an independently scheduled group. Runs can execute at the same time
      when resources are available. OSMO then collects their outputs into one combined result.

The CLI override root depends on the execution path:

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Run locally

      The Experiment Runner receives the Experiment Definition directly.

      * Use ``shared.<path>=<value>`` to change a shared value.
      * Use ``runs.<name>.<path>=<value>`` to change one Run.

      .. code-block:: bash

         python isaaclab_arena/evaluation/experiment_runner.py \
           --experiment_config path/to/experiment.yaml \
           shared.rollout_limit.num_steps=100

   .. tab-item:: Preview an OSMO workflow

      OSMO nests the Experiment below ``experiment_cfg``, so Experiment overrides need that prefix.

      * Use ``experiment_cfg.shared.<path>=<value>`` to change a shared value.
      * Use ``experiment_cfg.runs.<name>.<path>=<value>`` to change one Run.

      .. code-block:: bash

         python -m osmo.submit_arena_experiment \
           --experiment_cfg path/to/experiment.yaml \
           --dry_run \
           experiment_cfg.shared.rollout_limit.num_steps=100

      If Hydra suggests ``+shared.<path>=<value>``, do not add ``+``. Use
      ``experiment_cfg.shared.<path>=<value>`` instead.

Both commands override the same ``shared.rollout_limit.num_steps`` field declared in the
Experiment Definition. A value written inside an individual Run still takes priority over the
shared override.

For remote policies, configure the policy client inside its Run like any other policy. Start the
policy server separately for local execution. OSMO can co-schedule a server for supported policy
types.

Follow :doc:`First Arena Experiment <../quickstart/arena_experiment>` for a complete local
example.
For OSMO setup and submission options, see :doc:`Multi-node Evaluation
<../example_workflows/multi_node_evaluation/multi_node_evaluation>`.


Reuse values with ``shared``
----------------------------

``shared`` removes repetition. Arena applies these values to every Run, then places each Run's
own values on top. A Run only needs to declare what is different.

Values are applied in this order, from lowest to highest priority:

.. code-block:: text

   typed configuration defaults
                 ↓
   shared values, including shared.* CLI overrides
                 ↓
   values written in an individual Run
                 ↓
   runs.<name>.* CLI overrides

.. dropdown:: Configuration rules
   :animate: fade-in

   * The only top-level fields are ``shared`` and ``runs``.
   * ``runs`` must contain at least one Run.
   * A Run name starts with a letter or underscore. It can then contain letters, numbers,
     underscores, or hyphens.
   * An override can change a field on a Run declared in the YAML, but it cannot add another Run.
   * A shared override must point to a field already present below ``shared`` in the Experiment
     YAML. The Hydra operators ``+``, ``++``, and ``~`` are not supported for shared values.


Choosing a runner
-----------------

.. note::

   Use the **Experiment Runner** for policy evaluations defined in YAML. Use the **Environment
   Runner** (``isaaclab_arena/scripts/environment_runner.py``) to inspect and physically manipulate
   an environment without a policy. The **Policy Runner** is currently needed only for ``torchrun``
   multi-GPU execution or policy evaluation of an external environment loaded with
   ``--external_environment_class_path``.
