Assets
======

Assets are the objects and backgrounds that make up a scene.
Arena ships with a set of assets ready to use by name,
and new assets can be added by registering them in the asset library.

.. code-block:: python

   background = asset_registry.get_asset_by_name("kitchen")()
   cracker_box = asset_registry.get_asset_by_name("cracker_box")()

Registering a new asset
-----------------------

To add a new object, subclass ``LibraryObject``, provide the USD path and object type,
and decorate it with ``@register_asset``:

.. code-block:: python

   @register_asset
   class MyObject(LibraryObject):
       name = "my_object"
       tags = ["object", "graspable"]
       usd_path = "path/to/my_object.usd"
       object_type = ObjectType.RIGID

Once registered, the object is available in the registry like any other asset:

.. code-block:: python

   obj = asset_registry.get_asset_by_name("my_object")()

Assets can also be tagged to make them discoverable by category:

.. code-block:: python

   # All graspable objects
   objects = asset_registry.get_assets_by_tag("graspable")

   # A random graspable object
   obj = asset_registry.get_random_asset_by_tag("graspable")()

Useful tags include ``"graspable"``, ``"openable"``, ``"pressable"``, and ``"background"``.
Assets can have multiple tags — for example, a fruit is tagged both ``"graspable"`` and ``"food"``.

Object types
------------

Every asset has an object type that determines how it is simulated:

- **RIGID** — a single rigid body (boxes, bottles, tools, furniture).
- **ARTICULATION** — a multi-body object with joints (robots, doors, drawers, appliances).
- **BASE** — no physics; used for static backgrounds and markers.

Backgrounds
-----------

Backgrounds are registered as ``BASE`` assets, but their composed USDs may contain
dynamic rigid bodies and articulations whose states can change as they interact with
the robot or other objects. Arena resets these nested physics roots by default. Set
``reset_nested_physics=False`` on a ``Background`` to opt out.

Arena registers the roots as private Isaac Lab reset views. After simulation and RTX
initialization, Arena creates the views and records one environment-local pose and
joint configuration. On each episode reset, Arena applies those values to the
resetting environments and zeros all root and joint velocities. The private views
are not exposed through the Isaac Lab scene entity registries.

Arena discovers nested roots through the composed USD physics APIs.

Included:

- Standalone rigid bodies.
- Articulation roots, which own their links and joints.

Excluded:

- ``BASE`` and collision-only prims.
- Rigid and articulation roots owned by matching ``ObjectReference`` entries.
- Articulation links, which cannot own reset state independently.
- Authored roots without a live physics backend object after composition.

``BASE`` object references remain observational and do not transfer reset
ownership away from the background.

Instanceable subtrees that contribute dynamic physics are materialized at spawn
time because physics views cannot control dynamic instance proxies.

Object references
-----------------

A background asset like a kitchen is a single USD file containing many prims:
countertops, shelves, drawers, and so on. To use one of these internal prims
as a destination or interaction target (e.g. "place the object on the counter"),
you use an ``ObjectReference``.

.. code-block:: python

   kitchen = asset_registry.get_asset_by_name("kitchen")()

   counter = ObjectReference(
       name="kitchen_counter",
       prim_path="{ENV_REGEX_NS}/kitchen/counter_right_main_group/top_geometry",
       parent_asset=kitchen,
   )

   task = PickAndPlaceTask(
       pick_up_object=cracker_box,
       destination_location=counter,
       background_scene=kitchen,
   )

The ``parent_asset`` tells the environment which spawned USD the prim path belongs to.
The prim path uses ``{ENV_REGEX_NS}`` so it resolves correctly across parallel environments.

Rigid object sets
-----------------

To fill one scene role with different rigid objects across parallel
environments, wrap the candidates in a ``RigidObjectSet``. See
:doc:`./concept_rigid_object_set` for motivation, usage, and limitations.
