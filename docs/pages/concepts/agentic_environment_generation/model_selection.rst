Inference Model and Spec Quality
================================

How Arena Uses the Model
-------------------------

Arena does not reason about the scene. It builds a prompt from the catalogs, asks the model for a
JSON object matching the :doc:`ArenaEnvGraphSpec <../environment/environment_definition>` schema,
and validates the result. The model decides
what the environment contains. Arena only checks that the answer is admissible: each
``registry_name`` is registered, each relation kind exists, and each ``prim_path`` is in the
background's prim tree. A bad answer is rejected and saved as ``invalid_<name>.yaml`` with trace
lines, but Arena cannot fix it. The model must support OpenAI-compatible structured outputs
(``response_format={"type": "json_schema", ...}``).

Why Spec Quality Varies
-------------------------

Spec quality tracks model capability. Context length is usually the limiting factor: each pass
sends the full catalog in one request, and a model that cannot hold it answers from the part it
saw. This shows up as an unregistered asset name or an out-of-tree ``prim_path``, not as a length
error. Weaker models also:

* invent asset names
* drop objects
* anchor the scene to the background instead of the counter
* collapse five parallel pick-and-places into one atomic task
* pick a plausible-but-wrong prim out of several similar ones

Prompt Size at Scale
----------------------

Spec inference sends roughly 15 000 characters of catalogs. Prim path resolution sends the
background's entire prim tree — about 30 000 characters (10 000 tokens) for
``lightwheel_robocasa_kitchen`` (886 prims) — so a short-context model fails on that pass first.
Print the current catalog with ``--mode catalog``.

Selecting the Model
-------------------

Each endpoint preset has its own default model, so switching endpoints switches models (see
:ref:`agentic-env-gen-prerequisites`). The CLI runner overrides it per run with ``--model`` and
``--temperature``; the GUI runner selects the endpoint in the generation panel and uses that
endpoint's default model. For the public endpoint, any model in the
`NVIDIA NIM LLM API reference <https://docs.api.nvidia.com/nim/reference/llm-apis>`_ works, as long
as it supports strict structured outputs — a larger context window buys more reliable prim path
resolution.

.. note::
   The benchmark ran each of five documented prompts three times. Pass rate is the fraction of
   generated specs that matched the expected structure; runtime is the mean end-to-end
   ``generate_spec`` runtime. These results are snapshots rather than guarantees: model output is
   non-deterministic, and service load affects runtime.

How Model and Endpoint Affect Generation Metrics
------------------------------------------------

The model and endpoint both affect generation speed and reliability:

* **Model:** affects whether a spec passes validation and how often Arena must retry. Each retry adds another
  model call and increases runtime.
* **Endpoint:** affects response time through network and server performance. The same model can be faster or
  slower on different endpoints.

For example, Kimi K3 passed all 15 attempts without retries on both endpoints. Its mean runtime was 25.61 seconds
on the internal endpoint and 112.15 seconds on the public endpoint. Pass rates and retry counts also varied across
models.

Each row summarizes 15 attempts: five prompts run three times. The retry count is the total across those attempts.
Mean runtime covers the full ``generate_spec`` call, so it is different from the p50 time-to-first-spec metric on
the :ref:`performance-and-scaling` page. Results can change with model output and endpoint load.

Reviewing the Generated Spec
----------------------------

Output is non-deterministic, even at ``--temperature 0``. Validation only proves a spec is
admissible, not that it is the environment you asked for. Review every generated spec in the
:doc:`GUI live editor <gui_runner>` before generating data or
evaluating a policy against it:

* **Objects** — every object the prompt asked for is there, with no invented extras, and each
  ``registry_name`` is the asset you meant rather than a same-sounding sibling.
* **Anchor and relations** — the ``is_anchor`` subject is what the scene should be built around
  (the counter, not the background), and each ``on`` / ``next_to`` reference points at the
  intended node. This decides where the robot ends up.
* **Task** — the composition (``atomic`` / ``sequential`` / ``parallel``) matches the prompt, with
  one subtask per action and ``pick_up_object`` / ``destination_location`` not swapped.
* **Object references** — the resolved ``prim_path`` is the right prim out of the several similar
  ones a background offers, and an opened articulation carries the correct ``openable_joint_name``.
* **Sim preview** — run it. Objects intersecting geometry, or a robot that cannot reach the task
  objects, show up here and nowhere in validation.

The reviewed YAML can be used to reproduce the environment, but re-running the prompt to create the environment is not.
