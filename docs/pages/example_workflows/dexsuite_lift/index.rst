Dexsuite Kuka Allegro Lift Task (Newton)
=========================================

This example is an **experimental showcase for the Isaac Lab 3.0 Newton physics
backend**, demonstrating dexterous object lifting with the Kuka Allegro hand.
Training is performed in Isaac Lab and the resulting checkpoint is evaluated in
Arena — both using Newton (MuJoCo-Warp solver) for physically accurate contact
modelling during dexterous manipulation.

   **Newton Physics — Experimental**

   All Arena environments can switch to Newton physics by passing
   ``--presets newton`` on the command line. However, **Newton support is
   experimental** — only the ``dexsuite_lift`` example has been verified to
   work with Newton under the current simulation settings.  Other
   environments may require additional tuning of solver parameters and physics parameters
   to run correctly using Newton physics.


Task Overview
-------------

**Task ID:** ``dexsuite_lift``

**Task Description:** The Kuka arm with an Allegro dexterous hand lifts a procedurally
generated cuboid to a commanded target position using joint-space actions and
contact-rich proprioceptive observations — including fingertip contact forces, hand-tip
body states, object point cloud, and 5-step observation history.

   * - Property
     - Value
   * - **Tags**
     - Dexterous manipulation, contact-rich
   * - **Skills**
     - Reach, Grasp, Lift (multi-finger)
   * - **Embodiment**
     - Kuka LBR iiwa + Allegro Hand (7 DOF arm + 16 DOF hand)
   * - **Scene**
     - Procedural table (static background) with ground plane and lighting
   * - **Objects**
     - Procedural lift cuboid (``procedural_cube``)
   * - **Policy**
     - RSL-RL PPO (``KukaAllegroPPORunnerCfg``)
   * - **Training Method**
     - Reinforcement Learning (on-policy PPO) — trained in **Isaac Lab**
   * - **Physics Backend**
     - PhysX (default) or Newton (``--presets newton``)
   * - **Simulation Rate**
     - 200 Hz physics, 50 Hz control (decimation = 4)
   * - **Episode Length**
     - 6 seconds
   * - **Closed-loop**
     - Yes (50 Hz control)
   * - **Command Space**
     - Target position [x, y, z], position-only, resampled every 2–3 s

.. note::

   The physics backend defaults to **PhysX**. Pass ``--presets newton`` to
   ``policy_runner.py`` (Arena) or ``physics=newton_mjwarp`` to ``train.py`` (Isaac Lab)
   to switch to **Newton** (MuJoCo-Warp solver), which provides more physically
   accurate contacts for dexterous manipulation at the cost of slower simulation.
