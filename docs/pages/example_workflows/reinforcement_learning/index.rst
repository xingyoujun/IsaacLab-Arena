Franka Lift Object Task
========================

This example demonstrates the complete workflow for **reinforcement learning-based object lifting** with the Franka Panda robot. The environment is built in Isaac Lab Arena and passed to Isaac Lab for policy training with RSL-RL, and the resulting checkpoint is evaluated in closed loop in Isaac Lab Arena.

Task Overview
-------------

**Task ID:** ``lift_object``

**Task Description:** The Franka Panda robot learns to grasp and lift objects to target positions through reinforcement learning. The task uses a command-based goal specification, where the RL agent learns to reach sampled target poses.

Workflow
--------

This tutorial covers the pipeline for creating an RL environment in Isaac Lab Arena, passing it to
Isaac Lab to train a policy using RSL-RL, and evaluating the trained policy in closed-loop in
Isaac Lab Arena. A user can follow the whole pipeline, or can start at any intermediate step by
using the provided checkpoints.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start the isaaclab docker container

:docker_run_default:

We store models on Hugging Face, so you'll need log in to Hugging Face if you haven't already.

.. code-block:: bash

    hf auth login

You'll need to create folders for logs, checkpoints, and models:

.. code:: bash

    export LOG_DIR=logs/rsl_rl
    mkdir -p $LOG_DIR
    export MODELS_DIR=/models/isaaclab_arena/reinforcement_learning
    mkdir -p $MODELS_DIR

Workflow Steps

- :doc:`step_2_policy_training`
- :doc:`step_3_evaluation`
