Use the Generated Environment
-----------------------------

Once you are satisfied with the environment, you can use it to evaluate a policy on the environment.
The base container runs the environment as it was generated. The cuRobo-installed container additionally
gates object placement on whether the robot can reach the target objects.

For example, you can use the policy runner to evaluate a PI policy on the
environment. For other policy types, see
:doc:`Running a Real Policy <../../../quickstart/running_a_real_policy/index>`.

Open one terminal and run the following command outside the Arena docker container to launch the PI policy server:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./isaaclab_arena_openpi/docker/run_openpi_server.sh

In the other terminal, run the following command to launch the policy runner. The commands below use the
ready-made spec that ships with Arena; to evaluate a spec you generated yourself, point
``--env_spec`` at ``isaaclab_arena_environments/agent_generated/<env_name>.yaml``.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Policy evaluation (without reachability validation)
      :selected:

      .. code-block:: bash

         python isaaclab_arena/evaluation/policy_runner.py \
            --viz kit \
            --policy_type isaaclab_arena_openpi.policy.pi0_remote_policy.Pi0RemotePolicy \
            --enable_cameras \
            --num_envs 1 \
            --num_episodes 2 \
            --env_spec isaaclab_arena_environments/kitchen_bench/kitchen_bench_lightwheel_pick_and_place.yaml


   .. tab-item:: Policy evaluation (with cuRobo-based reachability validation)

      .. note::
         Reachability validation runs only in the cuRobo-installed Docker container
         (``./docker/run_docker.sh -c``). It is not available with a native ``uv``
         install — see :doc:`../../../quickstart/installation` and
         :ref:`ik-reachable-check`.

      If you want to ensure the robot can reach the target objects (i.e. mustard bottle and bowl), you can
      use this environment in the cuRobo-installed docker container to activate the reachability validation.

      **Docker Container**: Curobo-installed Base (see :doc:`../../../quickstart/installation` for more details)

      :docker_run_curobo:

      Now only the layouts the robot can reach are used:

      .. code-block:: bash

         python isaaclab_arena/evaluation/policy_runner.py \
            --viz kit \
            --policy_type isaaclab_arena_openpi.policy.pi0_remote_policy.Pi0RemotePolicy \
            --enable_cameras \
            --num_envs 1 \
            --num_episodes 2 \
            --env_spec isaaclab_arena_environments/kitchen_bench/kitchen_bench_lightwheel_pick_and_place.yaml

      While the environment builds, every batch of candidate layouts reports how many of them passed each
      check. ``ik_reachable`` is the cuRobo verdict, so its ratio is the pass rate to watch:

      .. code-block:: text

         [placement] Validated 50 candidate layout(s); passed per check: on_relation=49/50, next_to=45/50, not_next_to=50/50, face_to=50/50, no_overlap=50/50, ik_reachable=15/44

      A low ``ik_reachable`` ratio means most sampled layouts put the mustard bottle or the bowl outside the
      arm's workspace, and the placer keeps resampling.
      When an environment finds no reachable layout at all, it falls back to its lowest-loss layout.

      See :ref:`ik-reachable-check` for how this check is registered, what it requires, and how to tune
      or disable it.
