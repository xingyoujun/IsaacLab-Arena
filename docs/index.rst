Welcome to Isaac Lab Arena!
===========================

Isaac Lab Arena extends `Isaac Lab <https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/index.html>`_
with composable tools for creating robotics simulation environments and running them efficiently at scale.

.. note::
   This is the development version of Isaac Lab Arena. It contains the newest features but may not be fully tested yet.
   For the tested version, please refer to the `release/0.2.1 branch <https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab-Arena/release/0.2.1/index.html>`_.

| **Modular Environments**
| Compose scenes, embodiments, and tasks as reusable building blocks instead of duplicating full environment definitions.

| **Swappable assets**
| Run-time swapping of building blocks such as target objects and backgrounds allows parallel evaluation covering many variations of one task without code changes.

| **Automatic Object Placement**
| Define layouts with semantic spatial relations rather than hand-coded poses. Arena solves and validates candidate placements against object geometry, collisions, and task constraints.

| **Parallel Evaluation**
| Evaluate a policy across many parallel environments with aggregated metrics for high-level summary as well as per-episode recording for detailed analysis.
